			<h3>Impact of Terrorism on World Development</h3>
			<h4>What is this app about?</h4>
			<h5>Definition of terrorism</h5>
			<blockquote class="flow-text">
				"The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious,
				or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation."
			</blockquote>
			<p class="flow-text">
				The idea of the project is to give
				<strong>insightful information about the potential correlation that exists between the development of a country and terrorist
					attacks occuring in that particular country.</strong> To do so, we use the dataset provided by the World Bank along
				with an open-source global terrorism database.</p>
			<p class="flow-text">The former provide information about
				<strong>world development indicators</strong> such as CO2 emissions, birth death crude, number of hospital beds, all of this
				for more than 180 countries from 1960 to 2015. The latter dataset provide information on location, tactics, perpetrators,
				targets, and outcomes for more than 170'000
				<strong>terrorist attacks</strong> worldwide, from 1970 to 2016.
			</p>
			<h4>How to use it?</h4>
			<ol class="flow-text">
				<li>Close this menu.</li>
				<li>Click on the country you are interested in.</li>
				<li>The points represent terrorist attacks that happend between
					<strong>1970</strong> and
					<strong>2016</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the bottom right button to see details and explore correlations with social and economic indicators.</li>
			</ol>
			<hr class="divider"/>
			<h4>Data Story</h4>
			<p class="flow-text">
				The main idea was to make an appropriate selection of indicators from both databases to be able to show if any correlation
				could be drawn from it. The difficulty was to choose the most meaningful and straightforward indicators. After a long
				and meticulous inspection, we selected
				<strong>at first</strong> the following indicators, yearly, for each country:</p>
			<h5>Global Terrorism Database</h5>
			<ul class="flow-text">
				<li>Total number of attacks.</li>
				<li>Total number of victims.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="flow-text">
				In front of the compeling evidence that using only these two indicators was not enough to draw clear correlations between
				them and development indicators, we had to find a solution or potential improvement. Thus, we started to look for an
				<strong>index which encompasses for more variables</strong> and found the "
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Terrorism_Index" target="_gti">Global Terrorism Index</a>", or GTI, which is common in official reports done by institutional entities. This index is
				based on multiple variables to determine each country's score:
			</p>
			<ul class="flow-text">
				<li>Total number of terrorist attacks.</li>
				<li>Total number of fatalities caused by terrorism.</li>
				<li>Total number of injuries caused by terrorism.</li>
				<li>Approximate level of total property damage from terrorist attacks.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="flow-text">The weightings used to aggregate these variables into a single score were determined by consultation with the GPI Expert
				Panel:
			</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Variable</th>
						<th>Weight</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>

				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Total number of terrorist attacks</td>
						<td>1</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Total number of fatalities caused by terrorism</td>
						<td>3</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Total number of injuries caused by terrorism</td>
						<td>0.5</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Sum of property damages measure</td>
						<td>2</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p class="flow-text">Where the latest score "Sum of property damages measure" is further splitted into 4 different levels, each with its corresponding
				score:
			</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Damage level</th>
						<th>Score</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>

				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Unknown</td>
						<td>0</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Minor (likely
							< $1 million)</td>
								<td>1</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Major (likely between $1 million and $1 billion)</td>
						<td>2</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Catastrophic (likely > $1 billion)</td>
						<td>3</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p class="flow-text">The GTI is then calculated by a weighted sum of all the aforementioned indicators and we obtain this second version of
				the indicators' list, allowing us to rapidly grasp the context in which a country is:</p>
			<ul class="flow-text">
				<li>Number of attacks per year.</li>
				<li>Number of victims per year.</li>
				<li>Global Terrorism Index</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>World Development Indicators</h5>
			<ul class="flow-text">
				<li>Economic</li>
				<ul class="flow-text">
					<li>Tourism - number of arrivals</li>
					<li>Foreign direct investment (net inflows % GDP)</li>
					<li>Gross Domestic Product (annual % growth)</li>
					<li>Good and service imports (annual % growth)</li>
					<li>Good and service exports (annual % growth)</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Social &amp; Health</li>
				<ul class="flow-text">
					<li>Birth rate (per 1,000 people)</li>
					<li>Death rate (per 1,000 people)</li>
					<li>Armed forces personnel, total</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p class="flow-text">These indicators help us to understand the development process of a specific country in the following sectors : economy,
				social health, population and wealth. The delicate part was then to see if a link can exist between a pair of indicators
				chosen from each one of these two databases. However, this way of proceeding has a severe weak point: comparing only
				two indicators is equivalent to reducing a causal link to an unique variable while it includes several. To overcome on
				part of this issue, we decided to aggregate a subset of the GTD indicators in order to use the Global Terrorism Index
				(GTI) scoring system. This score is used in the well-known report of the same name published annually by Institute for
				Economics and Peace (IEP) to account for the relative impact of terrorism for a given year. The score, that was determined
				by GTI expert panel, is computed using four factors and different weight associated with: # description de la formule
				(ou lien sur page wikipedia, mais je pense que mettre la formule c’est bien!) Of course a similar index for the development
				indicators would be very desirable. Unfortunately, due to the very different nature of the indicators we selected, it
				was difficult from our position to create and define an index that can encapsulate all these aspects with justifiable
				reasons. Hence, as a precaution, we decided to left the development indicators as is. This doesn’t mean that we couldn’t
				draw conclusions from the data we have. Inspecting some countries we, indeed, found some interesting results were we
				think terrorism is directly but not only correlated. Here are a few examples. Philippines - Tourism Colombia - Tourism,
				Foreign inv Switzerland - Tourism, Foreign inv USA - Tourism, Foreign inv Algeria - Armed forces Peru - Forein inv South
				Africa - Armed forces Germany - Birth rate
