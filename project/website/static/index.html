			<h3>Impact of Terrorism on World Development</h3>
			<h4>What is this app about?</h4>
			<h5>Definition of terrorism</h5>
			<blockquote class="flow-text">
				"The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious,
				or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation."
			</blockquote>
			<p class="flow-text">
				The idea of the project is to give
				<strong>insightful information about the potential correlation that exists between the development of a country and terrorist
					attacks occuring in that particular country.</strong> To do so, we use the dataset provided by the World Bank along
				with an open-source global terrorism database.</p>
			<p class="flow-text">The former provide information about
				<strong>world development indicators</strong> such as CO2 emissions, birth death crude, number of hospital beds, all of this
				for more than 180 countries from 1960 to 2015. The latter dataset provide information on location, tactics, perpetrators,
				targets, and outcomes for more than 170'000
				<strong>terrorist attacks</strong> worldwide, from 1970 to 2016.
			</p>
			<h4>How to use it?</h4>
			<ol class="flow-text">
				<li>Close this menu.</li>
				<li>Click on the country you are interested in.</li>
				<li>The points represent terrorist attacks that happend between
					<strong>1970</strong> and
					<strong>2016</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the bottom right button to see details and explore correlations with social and economic indicators.</li>
			</ol>
			<hr class="divider" />
			<h4>Color Scheme</h4>
			<ul class="flow-text">
				<li>The color of each country is representing the total number of attacks that happened from 1960 to 2015. The darker (left), the
					higher.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<img src="/images/grayscale.jpg" height="40px" width="400px" />
			<ul class="flow-text">
				<li>When zoomed in, each point represents a terrorist attack in the country, from 1960 to 2015, with an indicaton of the
					density of the attacks. The lighter (right), the more attacks the region has suffered</li>
			</ul>
			<img src="/images/inferno.png" height="40px" width="400px" />

			<hr class="divider" />
			<h4>Data Story</h4>
			<p class="flow-text">
				The main idea was to make an appropriate selection of indicators from both databases to be able to show if any correlation
				could be drawn from it. The difficulty was to choose the most meaningful and straightforward indicators. After a long
				and meticulous inspection, we selected
				<strong>at first</strong> the following indicators, yearly, for each country:</p>
			<h5>Global Terrorism Database</h5>
			<ul class="flow-text">
				<li>Total number of attacks.</li>
				<li>Total number of victims.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="flow-text">
				In front of the compeling evidence that using only these two indicators was not enough to draw clear correlations between
				them and development indicators, we had to find a solution or potential improvement. Thus, we started to look for an
				<strong>index which encompasses for more variables</strong> and found the "
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Terrorism_Index" target="_gti">Global Terrorism Index</a>", or GTI, which is common in official reports done by institutional entities. This index is
				based on multiple variables to determine each country's score:
			</p>
			<ul class="flow-text">
				<li>Total number of terrorist attacks.</li>
				<li>Total number of fatalities caused by terrorism.</li>
				<li>Total number of injuries caused by terrorism.</li>
				<li>Approximate level of total property damage from terrorist attacks.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="flow-text">The weightings used to aggregate these variables into a single score were determined by consultation with the GPI Expert
				Panel:
			</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Variable</th>
						<th>Weight</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>

				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Total number of terrorist attacks</td>
						<td>1</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Total number of fatalities caused by terrorism</td>
						<td>3</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Total number of injuries caused by terrorism</td>
						<td>0.5</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Sum of property damages measure</td>
						<td>2</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p class="flow-text">Where the latest score "Sum of property damages measure" is further splitted into 4 different levels, each with its corresponding
				score:
			</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Damage level</th>
						<th>Score</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>

				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Unknown</td>
						<td>0</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Minor (likely
							< $1 million)</td>
								<td>1</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Major (likely between $1 million and $1 billion)</td>
						<td>2</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Catastrophic (likely > $1 billion)</td>
						<td>3</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p class="flow-text">The GTI is then calculated by a weighted sum of all the aforementioned indicators and we obtain this second version of
				the indicators' list, allowing us to rapidly grasp the context in which a country is:</p>
			<ul class="flow-text">
				<li>Number of attacks per year.</li>
				<li>Number of victims per year.</li>
				<li>Global Terrorism Index</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>World Development Indicators</h5>
			<ul class="flow-text">
				<li>Economic</li>
				<ul class="flow-text">
					<li>Tourism - number of arrivals</li>
					<li>Foreign direct investment (net inflows % GDP)</li>
					<li>Gross Domestic Product (annual % growth)</li>
					<li>Good and service imports (annual % growth)</li>
					<li>Good and service exports (annual % growth)</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Social &amp; Health</li>
				<ul class="flow-text">
					<li>Birth rate (per 1,000 people)</li>
					<li>Death rate (per 1,000 people)</li>
					<li>Armed forces personnel, total</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p class="flow-text">These indicators help us to understand the development process of a specific country in the two sectors : Economic and
				Social &amp; health. Inspecting some countries we, indeed, found some interesting results were we think terrorism is
				directly but not only correlated. Here are a few examples:
			</p>
			<h5>Philippines - Impact on tourism</h5>
			<p class="flow-text">Although the data for tourism is quite limited (1995-2013) for the Philippines, we can see that its increase has been
				slowed down by terrorism. We can see three main periods in our datapoints that express this behaviour.
			</p>
			<p class="flow-text">The country suffered a lot from the
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_the_Philippines#2010s" target="_blank">attacks</a>, particularly between 2000 and 2003. We are able to see the impact in the tourism indicator from a downtrend
				with two hard blows clearly distinguishable. Then, as the terrorism reduces in the following years it allows the tourism
				to grow at its full potential until it is again slowed down by a turbulent time with a spike in 2008 corresponding to
				a downfall in 2009 for the tourism.
			</p>

			<h5>Switzerland - Impact on Tourism and Foreign Investment</h5>
			<p class="flow-text">In a similar fashion, we can see that Switzerland also suffered drastically from a particular terrorist attack in the
				development of its tourism. Indeed, the
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zug_massacre" target="_blank">attack</a> of the canton’s parliament of Zug in the 27th September of 2001, where 15 people died, shaked the whole country
				and forced it to take stronger security measures. (même style d’image ici serait cool)</p>
			<p class="flow-text">Looking at another development indicator, it can be seen that the foreign direct investment also reacted from the terrorist
				attack.
			</p>

			<img src="/images/switzerland2.png" />

			<h5>South Africa - Impact on armed forces</h5>
			<p class="flow-text">Looking at the terrorism history of South Africa we observe a turbulent period in the 1991-1994 time window with the
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boipatong_massacre" target="_blank">boipatong massacre</a> at its culminating point.
				<br/>It is possible to see the response of the authorities to this period of activity: an increase of the number of armed
				forces. A few years later, with much fewer attacks, the authorities finally decided to reduce the headcount to its initial
				value.
			</p>

			<h5>Peru - Impact on Foreign Investment</h5>
			<p class="flow-text">It is interesting to see that countries victim of terrorism can also influence whether or not foreign countries will invest
				money in them. Peru characterizes this situation very well, as we can see that money starts flowing into the country
				as soon as it calms down. No need to say much, the graphs are very self-explanatory.</p>
			<img src="/images/peru.png" />


			<h5>Final words...</h5>
			<blockquote class="flow-text">
				<p>Remember that all these analysis are perfunctory and the mechanisms are so complex that it is difficult to model exactly
					why a trend is shifting or an indicator moving. We devided here to analyze the reactions through the lense of terrorist
					attacks but many other explanations might be appropriate.</p>
				<p> It has to be interpreted with caution, and rather used as an additional insight on the matter.</p>
